# Responsive_Layout

*This app improves on the previous one by including a responsive layout.

*On full and medium-sized screens like iPads, main content is centered with margins on on the left and right. 

*On mobile devices, main content takes up the full width of the viewport.

*The font-styles and colors have been changed and a personlized favicon is now included.
